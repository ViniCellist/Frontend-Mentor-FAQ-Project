## Overview

- That was great experience. For me as begginner using all this content to make it works properly, was just great on the very perspective!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

## My process

- Started building the semantics body with the `HTML5`;
  - Used tags like: `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, all of it in order to make as semantic as possible!
  - Added classes and ids to separate each content, knowing that in the future I was going to use it at `JavaScript` and `CSS5`;
- After I finished it, started working on the `CSS5` style;
  - As I said before, used all the classes and contents available and applied the styles;
  - I've never used `CSS Grid` before, so that was an adventure for me;
- Lastly, in the `script` I used  and array of images contained in the `<article>` tags;
  - Used an arrow function to separate each of them, and finally a `if()` to create the logic;

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS (custom properties, Flexbox, CSS Grid)
- JS

### What I learned

As I said before, that was a great expercience. Used some libraries I alredy knew and others I've never used before, such as CSS Grid.

### Useful resources

- [HTML5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) - This helped me with the structure.
- [CSS3](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - This is an amazing tutorial which helped me with the style.
- [CSS3-Grid](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) - This helped me a lot with the CSS grid.
- [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) - And the basics with JavaScript.
